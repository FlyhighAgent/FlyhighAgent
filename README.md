Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Lorena (you can call me Ari), I love butterflies and Iâ€™m diving into the world of coding! 
ðŸŒŸ While Iâ€™m still learning, Iâ€™m currently exploring C# and working towards my goal: creating a project related to Natal charts. ðŸŒ 

Feel free to connect with meâ€”Iâ€™d love to learn and grow together! ðŸš€
